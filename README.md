# eCommerce-GT

Building upon the success of the "Electronic-Homes" application, the company owner has requested the development of a new website for a business venture. The website, named "eCommerce GT," will serve as an online platform specifically designed for e-commerce transactions among registered users who are residents of Guatemala.

The primary objective of "eCommerce GT" is to provide a convenient and efficient platform for users to engage in online buying and selling within the Guatemalan market. Users will be able to create accounts, explore product listings, add items to their cart, and securely complete transactions. The platform will focus on facilitating direct interactions between buyers and sellers, fostering a sense of trust and enabling seamless transactions.

To realize this vision, the website will be developed using a technology stack consisting of Node.js and Express for the backend, along with [React](https://react.dev/) utilizing [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the frontend. The UI will be styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), resulting in a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

With "eCommerce GT," residents of Guatemala will have a dedicated platform for engaging in e-commerce activities, promoting local entrepreneurship, and facilitating economic growth. The platform will prioritize user experience, ensuring a smooth and intuitive interface that simplifies the buying and selling process.
